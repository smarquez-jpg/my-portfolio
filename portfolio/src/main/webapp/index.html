        <p>A brief intro:</p>
        <p>I am a CS student at Trinity University. I have always had an interest in
            cs ever since I was a kid. I volunteered with the School's Out Hackathon, held at Trinity University,
            and acted as their Director of Technology. I have also worked for the GEMS summer camp as a Python instructor
            as well as performing research for the University of the Incarnate Word's AVS Lab.</p>
        <p>After my STEP internship with Google has concluded, I hope to resume working with the University of the Incarnate Word's AVS Lab 
            and researching the uses of natural language processing. I also hope to work with my professors at Trinity on their research of 
            Saturn and it's rings.</p>
        <p>A few different hobbies that I have had over the years would be that I played the cello from elementary school until my senior year of 
            high school. I also have gained an interest in photography, however I have yet to get myself a camera that is more sophisticated than my phone.</p>
